To **upgrade the Authentication module** in your Laravel project, you have a few options depending on your needs:

---

### 1. **Upgrade Laravel Breeze or Jetstream (if used)**
If you use [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) or [Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/), update the package:

```bash
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
php artisan breeze:install
npm install && npm run build
php artisan migrate
```
or for Jetstream:
```bash
composer require laravel/jetstream
php artisan jetstream:install livewire
npm install && npm run build
php artisan migrate
```

---

### 2. **Use Laravel Fortify (API-driven authentication)**
Install [Fortify](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/fortify):

```bash
composer require laravel/fortify
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Fortify\FortifyServiceProvider"
php artisan migrate
```
Then follow the [Fortify documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/fortify) to configure features.

---

### 3. **Manual Upgrade**
- Update your `User` model, controllers, and routes to use new authentication features (like password confirmation, email verification, two-factor auth).
- Review the [Laravel 12.x authentication docs](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/authentication) for new features and best practices.

---

### 4. **Livewire Authentication ( Personally I use this one my project )** 
If you want a Livewire-based auth experience, consider [Laravel Breeze with Livewire](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/starter-kits#breeze-and-livewire):

```bash
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
php artisan breeze:install livewire
npm install && npm run build
php artisan migrate
```

---

**Summary:**  
- Choose a starter kit (Breeze, Jetstream, Fortify) and install/upgrade it.
- Run migrations and build assets.
- Update your authentication views and logic as needed.
