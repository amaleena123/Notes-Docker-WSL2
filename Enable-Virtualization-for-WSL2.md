  The Virtualization is enabled after the required setup.


The model is a **Lenovo ThinkPad with 11th Gen Intel i7-11850H**, here‚Äôs what you can do to enable virtualization so WSL 2 works:

---

### 1. Confirm CPU support

‚úÖ Your CPU **does support Intel VT-x (Virtualization Technology)** ‚Äî so it‚Äôs only a BIOS/UEFI setting issue, not hardware.

---

### 2. Enter BIOS/UEFI Setup

1. **Shut down** your ThinkPad completely.
2. Turn it on and press **F1** repeatedly when you see the Lenovo logo.

   * On some models, you may need to press **Enter** ‚Üí then choose **F1** for BIOS.

---

### 3. Enable Virtualization

Once inside BIOS:

* Go to **Security** ‚Üí **Virtualization**.
* Enable these options if available:

  * **Intel (R) Virtualization Technology (VT-x)**
  * **Intel (R) VT-d Feature**
* Some ThinkPads also show **Hyper-V / VTx** under **Config ‚Üí CPU**.

Save changes (**F10**) and restart.

---

### 4. Verify in Windows

After reboot:

1. Open **Task Manager ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí CPU**.

   * You should now see **Virtualization: Enabled**.
2. Open **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** and run:

   ```powershell
   systeminfo | find "Virtualization"
   ```

   It should say ‚ÄúEnabled in firmware.‚Äù

---

### 5. Only update BIOS if needed

* If you **don‚Äôt see the virtualization option at all** in BIOS, then you may need a BIOS update.
* Get the official update from **Lenovo Vantage** (Lenovo‚Äôs update utility) or from the **Lenovo support website** (enter your ThinkPad‚Äôs model number).

---

üëâ My suggestion: **Try enabling it in BIOS first**. If the option isn‚Äôt there, then we go with a BIOS update.
